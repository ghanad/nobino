# Nobino Reservations

Internal capacity-based reservation web application for a small company resource pool.

## Product Direction

- Systems are identical and modeled as one configurable resource pool.
- Users request one unit of capacity for an hourly time range.
- Reservations start as `PENDING`.
- Only `APPROVED` reservations consume capacity.
- Manager approval is required before a reservation is final.
- Working days and working hours are configurable through weekly schedule rows
  and date-specific exceptions.

Out-of-scope for this project unless explicitly requested: check-in, check-out, no-show handling, penalties, quotas, and physical device assignment.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js App Router
- TypeScript with strict mode
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui-compatible component setup
- Prisma
- SQLite for local and operational data
- Zod for validation in later phases
- Signed HTTP-only cookie sessions for authentication

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a local environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `AUTH_SECRET` in `.env` to a long random value before using shared or
production environments.

Apply the SQLite database migration and seed defaults:

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
npm run prisma:seed
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run start
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run prisma:push
npm run prisma:generate
npm run prisma:seed
```

## Seeded Data

The seed script creates:

- `admin@nobino.local` / `Admin123!`
- `manager@nobino.local` / `Manager123!`
- `user@nobino.local` / `User123!`
- Resource pool `Company Systems` with capacity `5`
- Weekly schedule using JavaScript `Date.getDay()` values: Sunday through Thursday and Saturday are `09:00-17:00`; Friday is disabled.

## Phase Status

Phase 3 is complete: seeded users can sign in with email and password, sessions are stored in signed HTTP-only cookies, logout is available, and dashboard, manager, and admin areas enforce role access. The schedule service now retrieves weekly working windows, applies date-specific exceptions, and validates reservation time ranges server-side.

Reservation creation, capacity checks, calendar views, and manager approval flows are intentionally left for later phases.

## Auth Routes

- `/login` accepts seeded user credentials.
- `/dashboard` is available to all authenticated active users.
- `/manager` is available to managers and admins.
- `/admin` is available to admins only.

## Schedule Rules

Working schedules use JavaScript `Date.getDay()` values: Sunday is `0`,
Monday is `1`, and Friday is `5`.

`lib/schedule.ts` provides:

- `getWorkingWindowForDate(date)` with schedule exception overrides.
- `validateReservationTimeRange({ startAt, endAt })` for exact hourly bounds,
  same-day reservations, minimum 1 hour, maximum one configured working day,
  enabled working days, and working-hour containment.
